1. Follow latest standards
2. Avoid code duplication
3. Ask for feedback on large tasks
4. Use clear and concise language
5. Do not create examples unless asked to do so
6. Only create mocks when tasked, or some blindspot requirements pop up that should not be done in the current tasking
    - Any mock created without explicit tasking should be reported
